**Objective**

The goal of this project is to analyze E-Commerce sales data to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product trends. This allows businesses to make informed decisions in areas such as inventory management, marketing, and customer retention.

**Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

Theory:
Raw data often contains missing, inconsistent, or invalid entries which can distort analytical results. Preprocessing ensures the quality and usability of the data.

Steps Taken:

Removed rows with missing CustomerID or Description values.

Filtered out rows with negative or zero values for Quantity and UnitPrice.

Created derived columns like TotalPrice (Quantity Ã— UnitPrice).

Concepts Used:

Data completeness

Handling null values

Outlier detection

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Theory:
EDA is used to summarize the main characteristics of the data and identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships. It guides hypothesis generation and model design.

Key Techniques:

Grouping and aggregating data (e.g., by Month, Product, Country)

Visualizing time series trends and distributions

Analyzing average metrics like AOV (Average Order Value)

Tools Used:

groupby, mean, sum, and plot from Pandas and Matplotlib

**Time Series Analysis**

Theory:
Time series analysis helps track how metrics evolve over time, revealing seasonal patterns, growth trends, and periods of high/low performance.

Concepts Applied:

Monthly & Quarterly aggregations

Rolling averages to smooth out daily noise

Why Important:

Businesses can plan promotions, stock, and logistics around seasonal demand.

**Customer Behavior Analysis**

Theory:
Understanding customer buying patterns is key to segmentation and personalization. Key metrics include purchase frequency, order value, and repeat purchase rate.

Insights Derived:

One-time vs repeat buyers

AOV (Average Order Value)

Country-based performance

**Product Performance Analysis**

Theory:
Product analytics help identify bestsellers and underperformers, enabling better inventory planning and pricing strategy.

Techniques:

Ranking by quantity sold and revenue

Analyzing price and quantity distribution for sales optimization

**Why This Matters**

Provides data-driven insights for business decisions

Identifies sales bottlenecks and customer drop-off points

Helps allocate marketing budget to top-selling regions and products

Guides pricing and bundling strategies
